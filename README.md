<!-- Brief -->
### Brief
A simple program which creates "Man In The Middle" attack by ARP spoofing using scapy.
The program uses our simple chat final project [link of the project here](https://github.com/amirg00/Simple-Chat.git).
Since the simple chat applies a non-secured applicative protocol that we have created, 
the chats can be exposed by an attacker that wants to sabotage the users' chats.
The attack explanation is based on a story that will be presented here.

# MITM - ARP POISONING

### Brief
A simple program which creates "Man In The Middle" attack by ARP spoofing using scapy.
The program uses our simple chat final project 'link of the project here'.
Since the simple chat applies a non-secured applicative protocol that we have created, 
the chats can be exposed by an attacker that wants to sabotage the users' chats.
The attack explanation is based on a story that will be presented here.
